I created this solo project given by scrimba with the figma file. <br>
I created a json data file containing array of objects which i iterated using map method to display the various journals<br>
I used Tailwind CSS for the project and also implemented light/dark mode toggle using state.<br>
I also implemented dark/light theme toggle which is saved to localStorage so save user prefered settings.
